This repository is for tryouts.

The master branch is a base branch with a simple main class.

If you want to do a new tryout/sandbox/testing/tutorial

create a new branch with the name of the project and work on that branch.

Remind yourself to list existing branches to see if there is anything you've forgotten.

=======================================================================================================================

in order to run this program from the command line:

navigate in terminal to src/main

    $ javac Main.java

this will compile the Main.java class in to Java bytecode so it can be executed by the JVM

in order to run the program you have to define the CLASSPATH with the -cp flag on the 'java' command
line call.

First cd to the src package (one dir up):

    $ java -cp ./ main.Main

You set the CLASSPATH with the -cp flag, then define the classpath as being in the current directory.
This means that you notify the JVM that the compiled .class file is in this directory (the path to the class file)
because you're now in the 'src' dir, you have to run the Main class WITH the package name 'main'
